Inventory Management Analysis
Problem Statement
Efficient inventory management is critical for organizations to:

Reduce operational costs
Evaluate inventory levels
Forecast demand
Achieve cost efficiency
Ensure customer satisfaction
This project addresses challenges related to demand variability, stockouts, and overstock situations. The primary objective was to classify inventory based on value and demand patterns using ABC and XYZ methodologies. Additionally, key metrics such as inventory turnover ratios, safety stock levels, and reorder points were calculated to optimize inventory management. Demand forecasting through Power BI provided data-driven insights, enhancing decision-making and proactive inventory control.

Objectives
Classify inventory based on value and demand patterns using ABC and XYZ analysis
Calculate key inventory metrics such as Inventory Turnover Ratio, Safety Stock Levels, and Reorder Points
Identify Stock Status Categories to monitor critical items
Leverage Demand Forecasting to improve inventory planning and management
Data Sources
Orders: (order date, SKU ID, order quantity)
Stock: (SKU ID, stock quantity, price)
Lead Time: Average duration between order placement and delivery (involves processing, manufacturing, packaging, shipping, and delivery)
Business Benefits
Stock Planning: Helps determine reorder points to prevent stockouts
Supplier Evaluation: Measures supplier reliability and efficiency
Cost Efficiency: Reduces excessive safety stock by predicting accurate restocking times
Customer Satisfaction: Ensures timely fulfillment of customer orders
Methodology
1. ABC Analysis
ABC Analysis categorizes inventory based on the revenue they generate. The steps involved include:

Gather data on inventory items (demand, cost, risk)
Rank the items from highest to lowest value
Calculate the percentage contribution of each item
Categorize items into A, B, or C groups based on their contribution to total revenue
Using Pareto's 80/20 rule, A items represent 20% of goods that generate 80% of the value, B items are of moderate importance, and C items are less critical.

2. XYZ Analysis
XYZ Analysis classifies inventory by demand variability:

X items: Have consistent demand and are easy to forecast
Y items: Exhibit moderate demand variability (e.g., seasonality)
Z items: Have the highest demand variability, making them difficult to forecast
This analysis helps improve inventory accuracy, enhance forecasting, reduce waste, and increase turnover.

Key Metrics Calculated
Inventory Turnover Ratio: Measures how often inventory is sold and replaced over a period
Safety Stock Calculation: Determines the optimal buffer stock to prevent stockouts
Reorder Points: Calculates the point at which inventory should be reordered to maintain stock levels
Stock Status Classification: Classifies inventory based on current stock levels (critical, low, excess)
Outcome
This analysis helped optimize stock levels, reduce operational costs, and improve inventory control. By applying ABC and XYZ classification methods, businesses can focus resources on high-value and high-demand items, streamline operations, and enhance customer satisfaction through more accurate demand forecasting and stock replenishment.
